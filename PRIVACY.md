# Reaper Privacy Policy
One of Reaper's core values is to respect the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy describes what data we collect, how it is used and your choices regarding your information.

## Consent
By using Reaper, or being in a server that uses Reaper, you consent to this Privacy Policy and its terms.

## Information we collect
We process no personal information. We do not store or share any of your personal information. We do store and process the following information:
- Server IDs
- User IDs
- Message IDs
- Channel IDs
- Role IDs
- Emoji IDs
- Message content
- Any input provided to Reaper (including, but not limited to action reasons)

## How we use your information
We use the information we collect to provide and maintain Reaper's services. We do not share your information with third parties, and we vow to never do so. We do not use your information for any other purposes.

## Your rights and choices
While using Reaper, you have the right to request the deletion of your data, regardless of your jurisdiction. You can do so by contacting the [Reaper Support Server](https://discord.gg/jhD3Xc5cm6). The process for data deletion is manual and will be processed as such:
1. You request data deletion
2. We will immediately remove any records that are older than 30 days from our databases
3. We will remove any records that are younger than 30 days as soon as they reach the 30 day mark
4. We will notify you when your data has been deleted

You may also request for a copy of your data. This process is also manual and will be processed as such:
1. You request a copy of your data
2. We will provide you with a JSON file containing all of your data

You may also request to not have your data stored. This process is fully automated and will be processed as such:
1. You request to not have your data stored
2. We will perform a "global kill". This will disable all Reaper functionality for you, including the usage of commands.

> Note: If you request to not have your data stored, information such as messages to servers that still use Reaper will still be stored for 24 hours to provide message edit and delete logs. This information will be deleted after 24 hours.
