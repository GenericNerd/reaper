## What is Reaper?
Reaper is a Discord bot that allows you to automate and make tasks easier that would normally take a lot of time and effort. It is designed to be easy to use and extremely customizable.

# Self Hosting Guide
## Requirements
- [A Discord Bot Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- **Optional:** [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Setup
### Minimum permissions
When adding Reaper to your server, you will need to give it the following permissions:
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Attach Files
- Kick Members
- Ban Members
- Manage Roles
- View Audit Logs

An additional scope of applications.commands is required for slash commands to work.

## Installation
### Docker
The prefered way to run Reaper is using Docker. This allows you to run Reaper in a container and allows you to easily update it. To run Reaper using Docker, you will need to create a `docker-compose.yml` file.
There is an example provided with the `docker-compose.example.yml` file. You can copy this file and rename it to `docker-compose.yml`. The docker-compose.yml file has some environment variables which you should edit to your preference.
#### Linux
1. Ensure you have installed Docker (and Docker Compose if following this guide)
2. Download the Reaper Repository (either by cloning it or downloading the repository)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenericNerd/reaper
```
3. Enter the directory and edit your `docker-compose.yml` file to preference.
4. Run the following command to start the bot
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
5. Run the /config command to start configuring the bot in your own server.
